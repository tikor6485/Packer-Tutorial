# For the "Packer_Image" file:

Packer build configuration for Amazon EBS

I've created a new Packer build configuration for Amazon EBS that creates an AMI named "Packer-Image-EC2-AWS". This build configuration uses Ubuntu as the base image, and creates an instance with the instance type t2.micro in the us-east-1 region. The source AMI is ami-007855ac798b5175e.


# For the Terraform files:

Terraform infrastructure configuration for AWS

I've created a new Terraform configuration for AWS that creates an EC2 instance and infrastructure for testing. This configuration retrieves the AMI generated by the Packer build configuration and creates an EC2 instance with the ID "packer_instance". Additionally, this configuration creates a new VPC with two subnets in different availability zones, and creates a security group for the load balancer.
